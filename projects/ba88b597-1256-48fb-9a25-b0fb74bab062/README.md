# Simple Calculator Application

A feature-rich calculator built with Python tkinter. Supports basic arithmetic operations, extended mathematical functions, memory operations, and expression parsing with proper operator precedence.

## Features

### Basic Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)

### Extended Mathematical Functions
- Percentage (%)
- Square Root (√)
- Square (x²)
- Reciprocal (1/x)
- Parentheses support for complex expressions

### Memory Functions
- M+: Add current value to memory
- M-: Subtract current value from memory
- MR: Recall value from memory
- MC: Clear memory

### Additional Features
- Expression preview before calculation
- Real-time result display
- Continuous calculation (result becomes next input)
- Keyboard support for faster input
- Multiple memory slots (4 slots)

## Installation

No external dependencies required! The calculator uses only Python standard library modules:
- `tkinter` - Built-in GUI library
- `math` - Mathematical functions
- `re` - Regular expressions (for expression parsing)

Simply ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
