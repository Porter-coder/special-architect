# No external dependencies required
# This calculator uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI, included with Python)
# - math (mathematical functions, included with Python)
#
# To run the application:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python main.py
#
# Note: requirements.txt is kept minimal as tkinter
# is part of Python's standard library.
